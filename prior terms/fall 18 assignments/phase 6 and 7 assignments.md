### Phase 6 Assignment
given your team's new development template (phase 5), prepare to generate 3 to 4 pages per team member, in support of a business objective. 
Your project should follow these steps. 
1. define the industry it will address. This can be any sector of the economy that your group deems interesting. 
2. address issues that impact the industry. Perhaps there is the need for a kind of website that fills an unmet need, for example, 
engaging students in the industry, out of college. 
3. allocate work items to each team mate. Any given page must contain a login, account maintenance, profile, terms of use, privacy policy, 
a 'contact us' page, as well as the actual product, itself. This might be a social network, a gallery of interactive media (such as you 
have built heretofore), or other web-based interactive product. 
4. Leverage the accumulated template of bootstrap, url parameters, cookies, for loops, data iteration, and other interactivity
toward producing the objective. 

Your work for phase 6 should be a skeletal outline, where each page is rendered by each team mate in an unfinished way. Errors may
be present, but each relevant section of code (bootstrap, javascript, for loops, html) should be present.

Phase 6 should show that work has begun. Allocated work is given to each team member, and coding has begun, where each page
has all the key programmable elements in place, but more refinement is needed. 

Phase 7 will demand that work is near completion, and can receive feedback before the final exam.
